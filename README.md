eHealth_node
============

The eHealth website is designed to ease the pain of finding a best-matched doctor for every patient and to allow patients and doctors to communicate online.

Data mining techniques are applied to mine the data source from yelp.com.

Bootstrap, jquery library, and HTML5 are used for the front-end; MongoDB on mongohq.com is used to persist all the data; the website is built with JavaScript and node.js with the Express.js framework; and now it is deployed on the AWS.
Selenium, JMeter, Firebug and profiling are applied for the website testing.

In progress:

Data has been fetched and cleaned from yelp.com; sentiment analysis is ready; search function is ready.

Now is working on making the front-end talk to the back-end.
